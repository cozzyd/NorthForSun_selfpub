% We are using the memoir class, which sets a bunch of differet settings on style. we set the font size to 10 but will scale it later (since our font doesn't support fractional sizes natiely). 
% openany means that a chapter can start on both left and right pages, otherwise they can only start on right pages
\documentclass[openany,10pt]{memoir}


% uncomment the following line to put draft at the top 
%\usepackage[placement=top,color=gray]{background}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\usepackage[size=pocket,trim=2,gutter=0.75in,inner=0.375in,outer=0.625in,top=0.875in,bottom=1in,noicc,paper=cream]{createspace}

% The following line is used for automatic quotes
\usepackage[english]{babel}

% The following line sets the font and scales it by 1.05. 10 pt * 1.05 = 10.5 pt
\usepackage[scaled=1.05]{ebgaramond}
